# Collaborative Whiteboard 
I’m thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project, a Collaborative Whiteboard application built using Node.js, React (Vite), and Socket.IO. This powerful tool allows multiple users to draw, sketch, and brainstorm together in real-time, making remote collaboration more dynamic and engaging.

# Key Features:
*  Real-Time Drawing: Instantaneous updates for all connected users.
*  Customizable Tools: Adjust brush color, size, and shape to suit your drawing needs.
*  Save and Clear: Easily save your creations or clear the canvas with a single click.
*  Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
*  Modern Stack: Built with the latest technologies including Vite for blazing fast          development and Socket.IO for seamless real-time communication.
# Technical Stack:
* Node.js for the backend server
* React (Vite) for the frontend interface
* Socket.IO for real-time, bi-directional communication
I’ve focused on creating a smooth and intuitive user experience, incorporating animations and a sleek design to make the whiteboard both functional and visually appealing. This project has been a fantastic opportunity to delve deeper into real-time web applications and modern frontend development tools.

Feel free to check out the project on my GitHub and connect if you'd like to discuss it further or collaborate on future projects!
