# Collaborative Whiteboard  
I’m thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project, a Collaborative Whiteboard application built using Node.js, React (Vite), and Socket.IO. This powerful tool allows multiple users to draw, sketch, and brainstorm together in real-time, making remote collaboration more 
dynamic and engaging.

# Key Features:
🎨 Real-Time Drawing: Instantaneous updates for all connected users.
🎨 Customizable Tools: Adjust brush color, size, and shape to suit your drawing needs.
💾 Save and Clear: Easily save your creations or clear the canvas with a single click.
🔄 Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
🔧 Modern Stack: Built with the latest technologies including Vite for blazing fast development and Socket.IO for seamless real-time communication.

# Technical Stack:
* Node.js for the backend server
* React (Vite) for the frontend interface
* Socket.IO for real-time, bi-directional communication
I’ve focused on creating a smooth and intuitive user experience, incorporating animations and a sleek design to make the whiteboard both functional and visually appealing. This project has been a fantastic opportunity to delve deeper into real-time web applications and modern frontend development tools.
